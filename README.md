**bSecure**

The idea behind bSecure was to be a free, open source addon revolved around the idea of server security. I wanted this to be free and open source because there are little to no public security type addons because the majority of them are on gmodstore unavaliable for everyone.

The features this currently has at the time of writing this are the following:
- VPN Detection
- Family share alt detection
- Detects recently made steam accounts (within 1 week)
- Detects un-setup community profiles
- Detects detoured screengrab functions
- Notifies superadmins when cslua is enabled just in case they are unaware
- Detects and prevents meth's chat spamming
- Anti Exploit
- Some anticheat precautions
- Key logger
- Logging system. Not made to replace a real logging system.
- Restrict people from certain countries from joining, such as french people.
- In game menu

... and there are more to come :)
