**bSecure**

The idea behind bSecure was to be a free, open source addon revolved around the idea of server security. I wanted this to be free and open source because there are little to no public security type addons because the majority of them are on gmodstore unavaliable for everyone.

The features this currently has at the time of writing this are the following:
- VPN Detection
- Family share alt detection
- Detects recently made steam accounts (within 1 week)
- Detects un-setup community profiles

... and there are more to come :)
